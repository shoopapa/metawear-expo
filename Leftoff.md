added a simple async function, concerened about seeing logs.
only running through simulator for now, which likey won't work for ble
can see logs like this though

```bash
[CoreBluetooth] API MISUSE: <CBCentralManager: 0x600001786d00> has no restore identifier but the delegate implements the centralManager:willRestoreState: method.
Restoring will not be supported
[CoreBluetooth] XPC connection invalid
```

seems promissing though
